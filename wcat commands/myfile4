I am in myfile4.




$node wcat (--commands from below--) used to display or make a copy content of one or more files in the terminal.

--> Commands:
a: wcat filepath => displays content of the file in the terminal.
b: wcat filepath1 filepath2 filepath3........  => displays content of all files in the terminal(contactinated form) in the given order. 
c: wcat -s filepath => convert big line breaks into a singular line break.
d: wcat -n filepath => give numbering to all the lines  .
e: wcat -b filepath => give numbering to non-empty lines  .
f: wcat filepath > filename2path => put all the content of filename into filename2 by overriding and also creates filename2 if it doesn't exist. 
g: wcat filename2path >> filename2path => append all the content of filename into filename2
h: node wcat -s filename > filename2 =>get the file content of filename remove large spaces and save the output in filename2.
We can mix and match the options.

-->Edge cases:

1- If file entered is not found then it gives file does not exist error.
2- -n and -b are 2 options available together then command should give you an error.
